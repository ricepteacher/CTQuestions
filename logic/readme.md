**This category of questions will ask the students to solve non-algorithmic puzzles to encourage rigorous reasoning and case analysis. **

Example:

In a recent test of 100 students, 
  - 95 answered question 1 correctly
  - 75 answered question 2 correctly
  - 97 answered question 3 correctly
  - 95 answered question 4 correctly
  - 96 answered question 5 correctly

What is the smallest number of students who could have answered exactly 4 of the 5 questions correctly?

(A) 3   (B) 4  (C) 5  (D) 8  (E) 17

*Solution:*

A maximum of 75 could have answered all questions correctly. Of the remaining 25, the 5 who got question 1 wrong, the 3 who got question 3 wrong, the 5 who got question 4 wrong and the 4 who got question 5 wrong could have been uniquely different giving 17 who got exactly 3 questions correct. This leaves 8 who got exactly 4 questions correct. Hence (D).
