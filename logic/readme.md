**This category of questions will ask the students to solve non-algorithmic puzzles to encourage rigorous reasoning and case analysis**

Relevance:

The ability to think logically is an essential requirement in IT.  In many questions, logical thinking leads to an algorithm (i.e. you apply the logic in a systematic, repeated fashion). In others, it is used in analysing an algorithm.
Although the questions in this section can be treated purely as logic problems, in several of them the logic could lead to an algorithm which could be used to solve the problem if the data was changed. For example, the approach taken in Rail Fence Cipher could be developed into an algorithm to decrypt an encrypted message of any length. Similarly, the approaches taken in several of the other problems could be used in developing algorithms which could be used for any data. This is explored further in the chapter 'Development of Algorithms'.

Example:

In a recent test of 100 students, 
  - 95 answered question 1 correctly
  - 75 answered question 2 correctly
  - 97 answered question 3 correctly
  - 95 answered question 4 correctly
  - 96 answered question 5 correctly

What is the smallest number of students who could have answered exactly 4 of the 5 questions correctly?

(A) 3   (B) 4  (C) 5  (D) 8  (E) 17

*Solution:*

A maximum of 75 could have answered all questions correctly. Of the remaining 25, the 5 who got question 1 wrong, the 3 who got question 3 wrong, the 5 who got question 4 wrong and the 4 who got question 5 wrong could have been uniquely different giving 17 who got exactly 3 questions correct. This leaves 8 who got exactly 4 questions correct. Hence (D).
