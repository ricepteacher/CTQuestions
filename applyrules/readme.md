**This category of questions will ask the students to apply a well-defined set of rules to given data.**

Example: 

On a distant planet, the dominant carnivore, the zab, is nearing extinction. The number of zabs born in any year is one more that the (positive) difference between the number born in the previous year and the number born in the year before that. 

```
E.g. 
If 7 zabs were born last year and 5 the year before, 3 would be born this year. If 7 zabs were born last year and 10 the year before, 4 would be born this year. 
```

2 zabs were born in the year 2000 and 9 zabs were born in 2001. What is the first year after 2000 when just 1 zab will be born?

(A) 2009  (B) 2011  (C) 2013  (D) 2015  (E) 2017

*Solution: 

Applying the rule, we have 2, 9 -> 8 -> 2 -> 7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1

12 more years were required, hence (C) is the answer*
